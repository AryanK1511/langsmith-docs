# Email/password a.k.a. basic auth (beta) {#title}

LangSmith supports login via username/password with a few limitations during the beta period:

- You cannot change an existing installation from basic auth mode to OIDC mode or vice versa - installations must be either one or the other
- Users must be given their initial auto-generated password once they are invited. This password may be changed later by any Organization Admin.

## Requirements and features

- Your initial password must be least 12 characters long and have at least one lowercase, uppercase, and symbol
- There are no strict requirements for the secret used for signing JWTs, but we recommend securely generating a string of at least 32 characters. For example: `openssl rand -base64 32`

:::note
Changing the JWT secret will log out your users

Once configured, you will see a login screen like this:
