### Frequently Asked Questions:

#### What Stateful Resources are needed for the application?

-

#### How can we upgrade our application?

- We plan to release new minor versions of the LangSmith application every 6 weeks. This will include release notes and all changes should be backwards compatible. To upgrade, you will need to follow the upgrade instructions in the [Helm README](https://github.com/langchain-ai/helm/tree/main/charts/langsmith/README.md) and run a `helm upgrade langsmith --values <values file>`

#### How can we back up our application?

- Currently, we rely on PVCs/PV to power storage for our application. We strongly encourage setting up `Persistent Volume` backups or moving to a managed service for `Postgres` to support disaster recovery

#### How does load balancing work/ingress work?

- Currently, our application spins up one load balancer using a k8s service of type `LoadBalancer` for our frontend. If you do not want to set up a load balancer you can simply port-forward the frontend and use that as your external ip for the application. We also have an option for the chart to provision an ingress resource for the application.

#### How can we authenticate to the application?

- Currently, our self-hosted solution supports oauth as an authn solution. Note, we do offer a no-auth solution but highly recommend setting up oauth before moving into production.

#### How can I use External `Postgres` or `Redis`?

- You can configure external postgres or redis using the external sections in the `values.yaml` file. You will need to provide the connection url/params for the database/redis instance. Look at the configuration above example for more information.

#### What networking configuration is needed for the application?

Our deployment only needs egress for a few things:

- Fetching images (If mirroring your images, this may not be needed)
- Talking to any LLMs
- Talking to any external services you may have configured
- Fetching OAuth information
  Your VPC can set up rules to limit any other access. Note: We require the X-Tenant-Id to be allowed to be passed through to the backend service. This is used to determine which tenant the request is for.

#### What resources should we allocate to the application?

- We recommend at least 4 vCPUs and 16GB of memory for our application.
- We have some default resources set in our `values.yaml` file. You can override these values to tune resource usage for your organization.
- If the metrics server is enabled in your cluster, we also recommend enabling autoscaling on all deployments.
