# Frequently Asked Questions:

#### What Stateful Resources are needed for the application?

LangSmith uses the following stateful resources:

- `Postgres`: Used for storing application data
- `Redis`: Used for caching and storing session data
- `ClickHouse`: Used for storing traces and metrics

* All of these resources can be configured to be externally.

#### How does load balancing work/ingress work?

- You will need to expose the frontend container/service to your applications/users. This will handle routing to all downstream services.

#### How can we authenticate to the application?

- Currently, our self-hosted solution supports SSO with OAuth2.0 and OIDC as an authn solution. Note, we do offer a no-auth solution but highly recommend setting up oauth before moving into production.

You can find more information on setting up SSO in the [configuration section](./self_hosting/configuration/sso) guide.

#### Can I use external datastores?

- You can configure LangSmith to use external versions of all datastores. In a production setting, we strongly recommend using external datastores. Check out the [configuration section](./self_hosting/configuration) guide for more information.

#### What networking configuration is needed for the application?

Our deployment only needs egress for a few things:

- Fetching images (If mirroring your images, this may not be needed)
- Talking to any LLMs
- Talking to any external services you may have configured
- Fetching OAuth information
  Your VPC can set up rules to limit any other access. Note: We require the `X-Tenant-Id` header to be allowed to be passed through to the backend service. This is used to determine which tenant the request is for.
