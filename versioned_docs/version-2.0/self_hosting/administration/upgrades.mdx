# General Upgrade Instructions

For general upgrade instructions, please follow the instructions below. Certain versions may have specific upgrade instructions, which will be detailed in more specific upgrade guides.

## Kubernetes(Helm)

If you don't have the repo added, run the following command to add it:
```bash
helm repo add langchain https://langchain-ai.github.io/helm/
```

Update your local helm repo
```bash
helm repo update
```

Update your helm chart config file with any updates that are needed in the new version. These will be detailed in the release notes for the new version.

Run the following command to upgrade the chart(replace version with the version you want to upgrade to):
```bash
helm upgrade <release-name> langchain/langsmith --version <version> --values <path-to-values-file>
```

Verify that the upgrade was successful:
```bash
helm status <release-name>
```
All pods should be in the `Running` state. Verify that clickhouse is running and that both `migrations` jobs have completed.

```bash
kubectl get pods

### Validate your deployment:

1. Run `kubectl get services`

    Output should look something like:

    ```bash
    NAME                    TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP                                                               PORT(S)        AGE
    langsmith-backend       ClusterIP      172.20.140.77    <none>                                                                    1984/TCP       35h
    langsmith-frontend           LoadBalancer   172.20.253.251   <external ip>   80:31591/TCP   35h
    langsmith-platform-backend   ClusterIP      172.20.112.234   <none>                                                                    1985/TCP       35h
    langsmith-playground    ClusterIP      172.20.153.194   <none>                                                                    3001/TCP       9h
    langsmith-postgres      ClusterIP      172.20.244.82    <none>                                                                    5432/TCP       35h
    langsmith-redis         ClusterIP      172.20.81.217    <none>                                                                    6379/TCP       35h
    ```

2. Curl the external ip of the `langsmith-frontend` service:

    ```bash
    curl <external ip>/api/tenants
    [{"id":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","has_waitlist_access":true,"created_at":"2023-09-13T18:25:10.488407","display_name":"Personal","config":{"is_personal":true,"max_identities":1},"tenant_handle":"default"}]%
    ```

3. Visit the external ip for the `langsmith-frontend` service on your browser

    The Langsmith UI should be visible/operational

## Docker

Upgrading the Docker version of LangSmith is a bit more involved than the Helm version and may require a small amount of downtime. Please follow the instructions below to upgrade your Docker version of LangSmith.

1. Update your `docker-compose.yml` file to the file used in the latest release. You can find this in the [LangSmith SDK GitHub repository](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langsmith-sdk/blob/main/python/langsmith/cli/docker-compose.yaml)
2. Update your `.env` file with any new environment variables that are required in the new version. These will be detailed in the release notes for the new version.
3. Run the following command to stop your current LangSmith instance:
```bash
docker-compose down
```
4. Run the following command to start your new LangSmith instance:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

Verify that the upgrade was successful:
```bash
docker ps
```

You should see all of the LangSmith containers running and healthy.

```bash
