## Week of May 13, 2024 - LangSmith v0.5

LangSmith v0.5 improves performance and reliability, adds features to improve regression testing, production monitoring and automation, and implements Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC).

### Breaking changes[](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/self_hosting/release_notes#breaking-changes)

- We will be dropping support for API keys on July 1st 2024 in favor of personal access tokens (PATs) and Service Keys. We recommend using PATs and Service Keys for all new integrations. **API keys prefixed with `ls__` will NO LONGER work as of LangSmith Helm release v0.7 to be released on or after July 1, 2024.**

### New Features

- Role-Based Access Controls. See: [https://blog.langchain.dev/access-control-updates-for-langsmith/](https://blog.langchain.dev/access-control-updates-for-langsmith/)
- Improved regression testing experience. See: [https://blog.langchain.dev/regression-testing/](https://blog.langchain.dev/regression-testing/)
- Improved production monitoring and automation: See: [https://blog.langchain.dev/langsmith-production-logging-automations/](https://blog.langchain.dev/langsmith-production-logging-automations/)

### Performance and Reliability Changes

- Split ingest, session deletion, and automation jobs to execute within separate resource pools.

### Infrastructure changes

- As of LangSmith v0.4, Clickhouse persistence now uses `50Gi` of storage by default. You can adjust this by changing the `clickhouse.statefulSet.persistence.size` value in your `values.yaml` file.
  - If your existing configuration cannot support 50Gi, you may need to resize your existing storage class or set `clickhouse.statefulSet.persistence.size` to the previous default value of `8Gi`.
  - It is **strongly** recommend that you monitor the consumption of storage on your Clickhouse volume to ensure the volume does not near full capacity, which may cause run ingest to behave erratically.
- New Platform-Backend service used internally. This service also uses itâ€™s own image. You may need to adjust your helm `values` files accordingly.

### Admin changes

- Added new Role-Based Access Controls. For more details see the [Admin](/concepts/admin) and [Set Up Access Control](/how_to_guides/setup/set_up_access_control) sections of the docs.
- Introduction of PATs and Service Keys. Old API keys have been migrated to service keys.

### Deprecation notices

With the release of v0.5:

- LangSmith v0.4.x and earlier are now in maintenance mode and may only receive critical security fixes.
