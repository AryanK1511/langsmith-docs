# Set up automation rules

While you can manually sift through and process production logs from our LLM application, it often becomes difficult as your application scales to more users.
LangSmith provides a powerful feature called automations that allow you to trigger certain actions on your trace data.
At a high level, automations are defined by a **filter**, **sampling rate**, and **action**.

Automation rules can trigger actions such as online evaluation, adding inputs/outputs of traces to a dataset, adding to an annotation queue, and triggering a webhook.

An example of an automation you can set up can be *"trigger an online evaluation that grades on vagueness for all of my downvoted traces."*
