# Create dashboards

With custom dashboards you can create tailored dashboards for tracking metrics that matter most to your application monitoring needs.

## Creating a new dashboard

1. Navigate to the `Dashboards` tab in the left sidebar.
2. Click on the `+ Dashboard` button.
3. Give your dashboard a name and a description.
4. Click on `Create`.

You'll see all of your dashboards displayed in a table view.

## Adding charts to your dashboard

1. Within a dashboard, click on the `+ Chart` button to open up the chart creation pane.
2. Give your chart a name and a description.
3. Select one or more projects to track metrics for.
4. Choose a metric from the dropdown menu to set the y-axis of your chart.

With a project and a metric selected, you'll see a preview of your chart and the matching runs.

## Filtering traces in your chart

Use the **Chart filters** section to refine the matching runs. These are the same filters available on the Projects page and apply to all data series in the chart. (See [Filter traces in application](./filter_traces_in_application) for more information on filtering traces.)

## Comparing data within a chart

There are two ways to compare data in a chart (i.e. create multiple lines in a chart):

1. **Multiple metrics**: Add multiple metrics with the same unit to a single chart. Each metric appears as a separate line. For example, compare P99 with P50 latency.
   When you pick an initial metric, the comparison metrics dropdown will only show metrics with the same unit.

Or

2. **Data series**: Create multiple data series within a chart, each with its own filters. This is useful for comparing granular data within a single metric.
   An example of using data series is to compare the performance of two different models or configurations. Name each series and apply specific filters.

## Chart display options

- Choose between a line chart and a bar chart for visualizing (you can toggle this within the dashboard view)
- Optionally reassign the chart to a different dashboard

## Saving and managing charts

- Click `Save` to save your chart to the dashboard.
- Edit or delete a chart by clicking the triple line button in the top right of the chart.
- Clone a chart by clicking the triple line button in the top right of the chart and selecting `+ Clone`. This will open a new chart creation pane with the same configurations as the original.

## View a chart in full screen

Click the expand icon in the top right corner of a chart to view it in full screen. This view offers:

- Greater detail on individual runs contributing to the chart data.
- The ability to change the time range of the chart.

## User journeys

1. **Use monitoring charts for mapping the decisions made by an agent at a particular node.**

Consider an email assistant agent. At a particular node it makes a decision about an email to:

- send an email back
- notify the user
- no response needed

You can track the decisions made by the agent at this node by creating a chart with the `Run count` as the metric and a different data series for each decision.
Using the chart filters, you can filter the runs to only show the runs at this node, in the example that decision is represented by a value in the output.
