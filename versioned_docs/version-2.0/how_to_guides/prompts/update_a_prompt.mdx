Click save, and your prompt metadata will be updated.

## Update the prompt content

To update the prompt content itself, you need to enter the prompt playground. Click "Edit in playground".
Now you can make changes to the prompt and test it with different inputs. When you're happy with the prompt, click "Commit" to save it.
