# Push/pull a prompt

## Install packages

<HubInstallationCodeTabs />

## Configure environment variables

If you already have `LANGCHAIN_API_KEY` set to your workspace's api key from LangSmith, you can skip this step.

Otherwise, get an API key for your workspace by navigating to `Settings > API Keys > Create API Key` in LangSmith.

Set your environment variable.

```bash
export LANGCHAIN_HUB_API_KEY="ls_..."
```

## Pull a prompt and use it

You can pull your own prompts and all of the public prompts in the LangChain Hub.

<HubPullCodeTabs />

You can also pull a specific commit of a prompt by specifying the commit hash.

```bash
prompt = hub.pull("efriis/my-first-prompt:56489e79")
```

## Push a prompt to your personal organization

For this step, you'll need the `handle` for your account!

<HubPushCodeTabs />
