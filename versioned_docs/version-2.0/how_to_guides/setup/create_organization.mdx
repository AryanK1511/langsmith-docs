# Create an organization

When you log in for the first time, a personal organization will be created for you automatically. 
If you'd like to collaborate with others, you can create an organizational and invite your team 
members to join.

To do this, head to the [setting pages](https://smith.langchain.com/settings) and click **Create Organization**.
Shared organizations require a credit card before they can be used. You will need to [setup billing](../setup_billing) to proceed.
