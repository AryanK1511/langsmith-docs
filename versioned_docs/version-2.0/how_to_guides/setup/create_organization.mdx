# Create an organization

When you log in for the first time, a personal organization will be created for you automatically. If you'd like to collaborate with others, you can create a separate organization and invite your team members to join.

To do this, head to the [settings page](https://smith.langchain.com/settings) and click **Create Organization**.  
Shared organizations require a credit card before they can be used. You will need to [set up billing](./set_up_billing) to proceed.  
Once you've subscribed, set up [workspaces](./set_up_workspace) to collaborate more effectively and isolate LangSmith resources between different groups of users.

## Personal vs shared organizations
There are a few important differences between your personal organization and shared organizations:

| Feature             | Personal            | Shared                                         |
|---------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Maximum workspaces  | 1                   | Variable, depending on plan (see pricing page) |
| Collaboration       | Cannot invite users | Can invite users                               |
| Billing: paid plans | Developer plan only | All other plans available                      |
