# Create an organization

When you log in for the first time, a personal organization will be created for you automatically. If you'd like to collaborate with others, you can create a separate organization and invite your team members to join.

To do this, head to the [settings page](https://smith.langchain.com/settings) and click **Create Organization**.
Shared organizations require a credit card before they can be used. You will need to [set up billing](./set_up_billing) to proceed.
