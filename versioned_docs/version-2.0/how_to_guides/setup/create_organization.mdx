# Create an organization

When you log in for the first time, a personal organization will be created for you automatically. If you'd like to collaborate with others, you can create a separate organization and invite your team members to join.

To do this, head to the [setting pages](https://smith.langchain.com/settings) and click **Create Organization**.
You can currently invite 4 members to your organization for free.
:::note
We charge for additional seats and usage. Please see the [pricing page](../../pricing) for more information.
