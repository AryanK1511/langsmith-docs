# Set up a workspace

:::info
Workspaces are not launched yet but are projected to launch by June 2024.
:::

When you log in for the first time, a default [workspace](../../concepts/admin/admin.mdx#workspaces) will be created for you automatically in your personal organization.
Workspaces are often used to separate resources between different teams, business units, or deployment environments. Most LangSmith activity happens in the context of a workspace, each of which has its own settings that are distinct from an organization's.<br />

```mermaid
graph TD
  Organization --> WorkspaceA[Workspace A]
  Organization --> WorkspaceB[Workspace B]
  Organization --> WorkspaceC[Workspace C]
  WorkspaceA --> tg1(Trace Project 1)
  WorkspaceA --> tg2(Trace Project 2)
  WorkspaceB --> tg3(Trace Project 3)
  WorkspaceB --> tg4(Trace Project 4)
  WorkspaceC --> tg5(Trace Project 5)
  WorkspaceC --> tg6(Trace Project 6)
```

<br />

To create a new workspace, head to the [setting pages](https://smith.langchain.com/settings) Workspaces tab and click **Create Workspace**.
Once your workspace has been created, you can manage its members and other configuration by selecting it on this page.
