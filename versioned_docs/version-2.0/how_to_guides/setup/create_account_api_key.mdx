## Create an API key

To log traces and run evaluations with LangSmith, you will need to create an API key to authenticate your requests.
Currently, an API key is scoped to a tenant, so you will need to create an API key for each tenant you want to use.

To create an API key head to the [setting pages](https://smith.langchain.com/settings), then scroll to the **API Keys** section. Then click **Create API Key.**
:::note
The API key will be shown only once, so make sure to copy it and store it in a safe place.
