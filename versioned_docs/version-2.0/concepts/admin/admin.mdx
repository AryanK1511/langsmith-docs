# Admin

This conceptual guide covers topics related to managing users, organizations, and workspaces within LangSmith.

## Organizations

An organization is a logical grouping of users within LangSmith with its own billing configuration. Typically, there is one organization per company. An organization can have multiple workspaces. For more details, see the [setup guide](../../how_to_guides/setup/create_organization.mdx).

## Workspaces (coming soon) {#workspaces}

A workspace is a logical grouping of users and resources within an organization. Users may have permissions in a workspace that grant them access to the resources in that workspace, including tracing projects, datasets, annotation queues, and prompts. For more details, see the [setup guide](../../how_to_guides/setup/set_up_workspace.mdx).

## Users

A user is a person who has access to LangSmith. Users can be members of one or more organizations and workspaces within those organizations.

## API keys

:::danger Dropping support July 1st, 2024
We will be dropping support for API keys on July 1st 2024 in favor of personal access tokens (PATs) and service keys. We recommend using PATs and service keys for all new integrations. API keys prefixed with `ls__` will NO LONGER work after July 1st, 2024.
:::

API keys are used to authenticate requests to the LangSmith API. They are created by users and scoped to a workspace. This means that all requests made with an API key will be associated with the workspace that the key was created in. The API key will have the ability to create, read, update, delete all resources within that workspace.

API keys are prefixed with `ls__`

## Personal access tokens (PATs)

Personal access tokens (PATs) are used to authenticate requests to the LangSmith API. They are created by users and scoped to a user. The PAT will have the same permissions as the user that created it.

PATs are prefixed with `lsv2_pt_`

## Service keys

Service keys are similar to PATs, but are used to authenticate requests to the LangSmith API on behalf of a service account.

Service keys are prefixed with `lsv2_sk_`

## Roles

Roles are used to define the permissions that a user has within a workspace. There are three built-in roles:

- `admin` - has full access to all resources within the workspace
- `viewer` - has read-only access to all resources within the workspace
- `user` - has full permissions except for workspace management (adding/removing users, changing roles, configuring service keys)
- `annotator` - has write permissions for feedback and notes in the workspace, but read-only access to other resources
