### _Are there any functional differences between US and EU cloud-managed LangSmith_?

There may be a small delay between launches to each region depending on the feature.
Besides that, they are functionally equivalent - all features supported in the US are supported in the EU.

LangSmith does not support this at the moment, but if you are interested, please contact support@langchain.dev and share your use case.

### _Can I connect an EU organization to a US organization and share billing_?

LangSmith does not support this at the moment, but if you are interested, please contact support@langchain.dev and share your use case.
