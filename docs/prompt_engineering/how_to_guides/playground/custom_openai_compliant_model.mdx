# Use a custom OpenAI compliant model

The LangSmith playground allows you to use any model that is compliant with the OpenAI API. You can utilize your model by setting the Proxy Provider for `OpenAI` in the playground.

If everything is set up correctly, you should see the model's response in the playground. You can also use this functionality to invoke downstream pipelines as well.

See how to store your model configuration for later use [here](./save_model_configuration).
