# Concepts

Prompt engineering is one the core pillars of LangSmith.
While traditional software application are built by writing code, AI applications often involve a good amount of writing prompts.
We aim to make this as easy possible by providing a set of tools designed to enable and facilitate prompt engineering.

## Why prompt engineering?

A prompt sets the stage for the model, like an audience member at an improv show directing the actor's next performance - it guides the model's
behavior without changing its underlying capabilities. Just as telling an actor to "be a pirate" determines how they act,
a prompt provides instructions, examples, and context that shape how the model responds.

Prompt engineering is important because it allows you to change the way the model behaves.
While there are other ways to change the model's behavior (like fine-tuning), prompt engineering is usually the simplest to get started with
and often provides the highest ROI.

We often see that prompt engineering is multi-disciplinary.
Sometimes the best prompt engineer is not the software engineer who is building the application, but rather the product manager
or another domain expert.
It is important to have the proper tooling and infrastructure to support this cross-disciplinary building.

## Prompts vs Prompt Templates

Although we often use these terms interchangably, it is important to understand the difference between "prompts" and "prompt templates".

Prompts refer to the messages that are passed into the language model.

Prompt Templates refer to a way of formatting information to get that prompt

## Prompts in LangSmith

You can store and version prompts templates in LangSmith.
There are few key aspects of a prompt template to understand.

### Messages vs Instruction
Single string vs messages
### F-string vs mustache
Ways to format prompts
### Tools

### Structured Output
What is structured output

### Model
Optionally, you can store a model configuration alongside a prompt template.
