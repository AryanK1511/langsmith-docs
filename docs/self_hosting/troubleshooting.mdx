# Troubleshooting

This guide will walk you through common issues you may encounter when running a self-hosted instance of LangSmith.

While running LangSmith, you may encounter unexpected 500 errors, slow performance, or other issues. This guide will help you diagnose and resolve these issues.

The first step in troubleshooting is to check the logs of the various services that make up LangSmith.

If running on Kubernetes, you can check the logs of your deployment by running the following command (replace `langsmith` with the name of your deployment if you deployed with a different name):

```bash
kubectl logs -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=langsmith --prefix -n <namespace> >> logs.txt
```

If running on Docker, you can check the logs your deployment by running the following command:

```bash
docker compose logs >> logs.txt
```

Generally, the main services you will want to analyze are:

- `langsmith-backend`: The main backend service.
- `langsmith-queue`: The queue service.

## Common issues

### _DB::Exception: Cannot reserve 1.00 MiB, not enough space: While executing WaitForAsyncInsert. (NOT_ENOUGH_SPACE)_

This error occurs when ClickHouse runs out of disk space. You will need to increase the disk space available to ClickHouse.

#### Kubernetes

In Kubernetes, you will need to increase the size of the ClickHouse PVC. To achieve this, you can perform the following steps:

1. Get the storage class of the PVC: `kubectl get pvc data-langsmith-clickhouse-0 -n <namespace> -o jsonpath='{.spec.storageClassName}'`
1. Ensure the storage class has AllowVolumeExpansion: true: `kubectl get sc <storage-class-name> -o jsonpath='{.allowVolumeExpansion}'`
   - If it is false, some storage classes can be updated to allow volume expansion.
   - To update the storage class, you can run `kubectl patch sc <storage-class-name> -p '{"allowVolumeExpansion": true}'`
   - If this fails, you may need to create a new storage class with the correct settings.
1. Edit your pvc to have the new size: `kubectl edit pvc data-langsmith-clickhouse-0 -n <namespace>` or `kubectl patch pvc data-langsmith-clickhouse-0 '{"spec":{"resources":{"requests":{"storage":"100Gi"}}}}' -n <namespace>`
1. Update your helm chart `langsmith_config.yaml` to new size(e.g `100 Gi`)
1. Delete the clickhouse statefulset `kubectl delete statefulset langsmith-clickhouse --cascade=orphan -n <namespace>`
1. Apply helm chart with updated size (You can follow the upgrade guide [here](./upgrades))
1. Your pvc should now have the new size. Verify by running `kubectl get pvc` and `kubectl exec langsmith-clickhouse-0 -- bash -c "df"`

#### Docker

In Docker, you will need to increase the size of the ClickHouse volume. To achieve this, you can perform the following steps:

1. Stop your instance of LangSmith. `docker compose down`
1. If using bind mount, you will need to increase the size of the mount point.
1. If using a docker `volume`, you will need to allocate more space to the volume/docker.

### CrashLoopBackOff (Kubernetes)

This error occurs when one of the services in your deployment is crashing repeatedly. You can check the logs of the service to determine the cause of the crash.

`kubectl get pods -n <namespace>`

You should see a pod in the `CrashLoopBackOff` state.

You can describe the pod to see the reason for the crash:

`kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n <namespace>`

There are a few common reasons for this error:

#### Out of memory

If the pod is running out of memory, you will need to increase the memory limit for the pod. You can do this by editing the deployment and increasing the `resources.limits.memory` value.


####

You can check the logs of the pod by running:

`kubectl logs <pod-name> -n <namespace>`

It is also common for these pods to restart if the health check fails. You can check the health of the pod by running:

`kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n <namespace>`

Under the `Events` section, you should see the reason for the restart.
