# Egress for Subscription Metrics and Operational Metadata

Self-Hosted LangSmith instances store all information locally and never send sensitive information outside your network. However, we do require egress to `https://beacon.langchain.com` to better remotely support our self-hosted customers. Currently, we track your usage of the platform for billing purposes according to the entitlements in your order form. In the future, we will introduce support diagnostics so that we can help ensure youâ€™re running LangSmith optimally in your environment.

**This will require egress to `https://beacon.langchain.com` from your network.**

Generally, data that we send to Beacon can be categorized as follows:

- Subscription Metrics
  - Subscription metrics are used to determine your access and use of the LangSmith, starting with the number of traces and number of users.
- Operational Metadata
  - This metadata will be collected to help with remote support, allowing the LangChain team to diagnose and troubleshoot performance issues more effectively.

## Example Payloads

In an effort to maximize transparency, we provide sample payloads here:

}
```
