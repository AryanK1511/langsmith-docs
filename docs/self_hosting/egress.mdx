# Egress for Subscription Metrics and Operational Metadata

By default, Self-Hosted LangSmith instances store all information locally and will never send sensitive information outside your network. However, we do require egress to `https://beacon.langchain.com` for two reasons:

1. Subscription Metrics:
    - Metrics used to determine Customer's access and use of the Licensed Platform, including but not limited to, the number of Traces, number of Users, number of Nodes Executed, or other mutually agreed criteria as set out in an Order Form.
    - This includes license verification and usage reporting.
2. Operational Metadata
    - Operational Metadata means usage information generated by the Licensed Platform and collected by LangChain for the purposes of delivering an optimal implementation of the Licensed Platform. Operational Metadata may include information such as type and version of the LangChain software, operating system version and environment type of Customer's Infrastructure, uptime and availability, system error logs and health metrics, product feature usage, general integrity and security of the Licensed Platform. For the avoidance of doubt, Operational Metadata will never include Customer Data, AI Content, or Customer Confidential Information.

This will require egress to `https://beacon.langchain.com` from your network.

## Example Payloads

### License Verification

POST beacon.langchain.com/v1/beacon/verify
```json
{
  "license: "<YOUR_LICENSE_KEY>"
}
```
Response:
```json
{
  "token": "Valid JWT" //Short-lived JWT token to avoid repeated license checks
}
```

### Usage Reporting

POST beacon.langchain.com/v1/beacon/ingest-traces
Example request payload:
```json
{
  "license": "<YOUR_LICENSE_KEY>",
  "trace_transactions": [
    {
      "id": "af28dfea-5358-463d-a2dc-37df1da72498",
      "tenant_id": "3a1c2b6f-4430-4b92-8a5b-79b8b567bbc1",
      "session_id": "b26ae531-cdb3-42a5-8bcf-05355199fe27",
      "trace_count": 5,
      "start_insertion_time": "2025-01-06T10:00:00Z",
      "end_insertion_time": "2025-01-06T11:00:00Z",
      "start_interval_time": "2025-01-06T09:00:00Z",
      "end_interval_time": "2025-01-06T10:00:00Z",
      "status": "completed",
      "num_failed_send_attempts": 0,
      "transaction_type": "type1",
      "organization_id": "c5b5f53a-4716-4326-8967-d4f7f7799735"
    }
  ]
}
```

Example response payload:
```json
{
  "inserted_count": 1 // Number of transactions successfully ingested
}
```
